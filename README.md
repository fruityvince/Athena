# What is Athena ?

Athena is an **API** and a **Tool** made to create and manage Sanity Check and Fix processes in Python.
It allow the user to define a Blueprint that define a list of process, parameters and other data to link processes or modify their behaviour.

The built-in tool works with a lot of the most used CG software that have a python interpreter like Autodesk Maya, The Foundry Katana, Mari, Nuke, SideFx Houdini, Blender, Unreal Engine etc... (Feel free to test it in another software)
Off course the tool also works as a standalone tool into Linux, MacOs and Windows.
